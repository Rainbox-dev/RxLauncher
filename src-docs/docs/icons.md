# Icons

To change the icon for an application, go to the [application settings](appsettings.md).

An ever-growing icon set is provided with *RxLauncher*. They're from [*RxUI*](http://rxui-docs.rainboxlab.org), released under the [Creative Commons Attribution, Share-Alike, Non-Commercial license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), so you can get and modify them at will.

You can find the one you need by using the search field at the bottom.

Searching for *Car* will show *car* and *cards* icons.

You can also use your own icons, not necessarily from this icon set, without even having to install any third-party icon pack. Just select any image file from your phone by browsing from the [application settings](appsettings.md). You can use any kind of image format, especially `.jpg`, `.svg`, `.png`...
