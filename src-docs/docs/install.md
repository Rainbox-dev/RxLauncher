# Installation

Just [download the .apk file](https://rainboxlab.org/tools/rxlauncher/) and install it. For now, it's only available from this website, but may be included in the *F-Droid* and *Google Play* repositories in the future.

You may need to authorize *Android* to install packages from other sources than the *Google Play Store*. You have to check the "*Install unknown apps*" or "*Unknown Sources*" option either in the *Security* settings or *Apps and notifications* settings of the phone, depending on the version of *Android*.

## Permissions

*RxLauncher* needs only two permissions:

- reading files to be able to let you select your own icons.
- uninstalling apps to... uninstall the apps you want to get rid of.
