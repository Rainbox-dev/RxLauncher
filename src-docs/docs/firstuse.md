# First use

When you've just installed *RxLauncher*, all applications will be given the same default icon.

This is to let you customize the launcher as you wish, you will be able to change the icon of each app individually.

Show the console. The console is a way for you to know what's going on on your phone and in *RxLauncher*. You can keep track of your use of the applications (the number of times you've launched them is shown), and for now *RxLauncher* monitors and shows you apps installation and removal. In the future, it may show other useful information.
